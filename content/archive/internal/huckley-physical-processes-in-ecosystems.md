These materials were designed to be used by life science students to learn how to apply physics to investigate the function of ecosystems. [...] Species and ecosystems continue to respond to climate change in unexpected waysâ€“ for example, shifting their distributions and abundances in directions opposite that expected. Such surprises highlight the need to translate our physical metrics of climates and climate change into how organisms are experiencing their environments. Differences in shape, coloration, and composition can lead two organisms to experience their shared environments very ...
